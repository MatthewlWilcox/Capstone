# Demand for Attendance in European Football Leagues

Football is one of the most popular sport in the world. In this project, factors that impact attendance are evaluated. These factors are the time and day of a match, the away team of a match, and the betting odds for a match. A Random forest model was also used to predict the attendance of matches.

The results of this project can be viewed [here](https://matthewlwilcox.github.io/Capstone/doc/Blog_post.html).

The structure of the repository is as follows:

[data](https://github.com/MatthewlWilcox/Capstone/tree/main/data) - Here is the data for the project. It is divided up into final_datasets, RAWDATA, and Data_to_change. The final_dataset is the datasets that are used within the analysis. RAWDATA is the raw data that was scraped. Finally, Data_to_change is many of the intermediate steps to go from RAWDATA to the final datasets.

[doc](https://github.com/MatthewlWilcox/Capstone/tree/main/doc) - Here is where the proposal of the draft as well as the analysis for the project blog post.

[presentations](https://github.com/MatthewlWilcox/Capstone/tree/main/presentations) - Here is where a presentation from the middle of the project as a summary of what was completed. 

[progress_reports](https://github.com/MatthewlWilcox/Capstone/tree/main/presentations) -Here is the progress reports of the project as it was developed. They are weekly.

[results](https://github.com/MatthewlWilcox/Capstone/tree/main/results) - Here is where graphs and visualizations from the projects are stored.

[src](https://github.com/MatthewlWilcox/Capstone/tree/main/src) - Here is where the predominant amount of the project is done. It is divided into the three different factors (Betting, Away Team Impact, and time/date), modeling, data processing, and data scraping.
