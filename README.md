# Demand for Attendance in European Football Leagues

Football is one of the most popular sport in the world. In this project, factors that impact attendance are evaluated. These factors are the time and day of a match, the away team of a match, and the betting odds for a match. A Random forest model was also used to predicted the attendance of matches. 

The results of this project can be viewed [here](https://matthewlwilcox.github.io/Capstone/doc/Blog_post.html).

The sturcutre of the repository is as follows:

[data](https://github.com/MatthewlWilcox/Capstone/tree/main/data) - Here is the data for the project it is divided up into final_datasets, RAWDATA, and Data_to_change. The final_dataset are datasets that are used within the analysis. RAWDATA is the raw data that was scraped. Finally Data_to_change is many of the intermediate steps to go from RAWDATA to the final datsets.
